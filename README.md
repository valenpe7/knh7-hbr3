# Bayesian optimization of electron energy from laser wakefield accelerators [Supplementary material]

This repository provides supplementary material for the paper P. Valenta et al., “Bayesian optimization of electron energy from laser wakefield accelerators”, *Physical Review Accelerators and Beams* **XX**, XXXXXX (2025); [https://doi.org/10.1103/knh7-hbr3](https://doi.org/10.1103/knh7-hbr3).

The supplementary material consists of raw data and a **[Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/)** notebook containing the analysis commands used to generate the figures in the paper. The analysis is performed in Python and relies on several open-source packages (see `requirements.txt`).

### Obtaining the data

The raw data used in this work are openly available on **[Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16941557)**. You may download the dataset as a `.zip` archive (6.5 GB) from the following link: [https://zenodo.org/records/16941558/files/data.zip?download=1](https://zenodo.org/records/16941558/files/data.zip?download=1).

### Obtaining the notebook

The Jupyter notebook `data_analysis.ipynb` is stored in this GitHub repository. You can either:

1. Download the repository as a `.zip` archive by selecting **Code → Download ZIP**, or  
2. Clone the repository with `git`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/valenpe7/knh7-hbr3.git
```

### Launching the notebook

If you have downloaded the notebook and data and installed all required dependencies, you can run the notebook locally. If you do not have all the requirements installed, you can launch the notebook online:
